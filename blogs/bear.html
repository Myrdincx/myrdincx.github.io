        <pre>――――― <b>The Fascinating History of the Word "Bear"</b> ―――――</pre>
        <p>
            The English word <b>bear</b> has an intriguing history, rooted in fear, mythology, 
            and a fascinating linguistic evolution. It derives from the Old English <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">bera</i>, which shares common ancestry 
            with the names for bears in other Germanic languages, such as the (modern) Swedish term 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">björn</i> or the Dutch term <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">beer</i>.
        </p>
        <hr style="height:5px; visibility:hidden;">
        <p>
            Interestingly, the word <b>bear</b> is unrelated to what linguists consider the 
            Proto-Indo-European term for bear: <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">h₂ŕ̥tḱos</i>. 
            This ancient root gave rise to the Latin <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">ursus</i> and the Greek 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">ἄρκτος</i> (more on these later!).
            <br>
            Instead, <b>bear</b> originates from the Proto-Indo-European root 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">*bher-</i> (meaning "brown"), which evolved into the Proto-Germanic 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">*bero</i>, meaning "the brown one," and eventually into the Old English 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">*bera</i>, which closely resembles the modern English word.
        </p>
        <hr style="height:5px; visibility:hidden;">
        <p>
            The rise of this term is linked to a fascinating cultural phenomenon: <b>taboo avoidance</b>.<br>
            Proto-Germanic tribes believed that calling the true name of the bear 
            (<i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">h₂ŕ̥tḱos</i>) might summon the powerful animal.
            To avoid this danger, they adopted euphemistic terms, leading to the creation 
            of <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">*bero</i> and its linguistic descendants, including <b>bear</b>.
        </p>
        <hr style="height:5px; visibility:hidden;">
        <p>
            While Germanic languages opted for euphemisms, other language families preserved the original name. 
            Latin gave us <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">ursus</i> (which survives in the scientific term 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">Ursidae</i>), and Greek retained <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">ἄρκτος</i>.
            <br>
            The term <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">ἄρκτος</i> also plays a key role in the naming of the Arctic and Antarctic. 
            The Arctic derives its name from the Greek <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">arktikos</i>, meaning "of the bear," in reference to the 
            constellation Ursa Major, the "Great Bear," which is prominently visible in the northern sky. <br>
            The Antarctic, on the other hand, literally means "opposite the bear," as it refers to the southernmost 
            region of the Earth, where Ursa Major is not visible.
        </p>
        <hr style="height:5px; visibility:hidden;">
        <p>
            Bears have also left their mark on names and cultural symbols. For example, the name 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">Ursula</i> means "little she-bear," popularized by the famous movie character. <br>
            Germanic languages contribute names like <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">Bernard</i> ("strong as a bear"), the Swiss 
            city of Bern (reportedly named after the first animal its founder hunted: a bear!), and the Old English 
            <i style="color: #dbdbdbff;">Beowulf</i>, a poetic kenning¹ for bear that means "bee-wolf."
        </p>
        <hr style="height:5px; visibility:hidden;">
        <p>
            The bear’s imposing presence has left its mark on our language, culture, and legends!
